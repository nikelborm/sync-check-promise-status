# Security Policy

Thanks for helping make this project safer for everyone!

I take the security of my projects, services very seriously, and try to fix any security issues in all of my open source code repositories as fast as I could.

## Supported Versions

I have resources to support only the latest versions and so I don't backpropagate security fixes to older versions. I'm sorry and I hope for your understanding. If you want extended support for the project I'm willing to set up an agreement on a commercial basis. For that open an issue, or write me an email at evadev@duck.com.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of my repositories, please report it to me.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to evadev@duck.com.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help me better understand and resolve the issue:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible). The greatest thing you can do is to create a reproducible environment such as docker container image or a repo with the poc.
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me triage your report more quickly.
